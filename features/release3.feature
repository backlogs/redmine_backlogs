Feature: Release management
  As a product owner
  I want to manage releases
  So that i can break down a large product backlog

  Background:
    Given the ecookbook project has the backlogs plugin enabled
      And no versions or issues exist
      And I am a product owner of the project
      And I have defined the following sprints:
        | name       | sprint_start_date | effective_date |
        | Sprint 001 | 2010-01-01        | 2010-01-31     |
        | Sprint 002 | 2010-02-01        | 2010-02-28     |
        | Sprint 003 | 2010-03-01        | 2010-03-31     |
      And I have defined the following releases:
        | name    | project    | release_start_date | release_end_date |
        | Rel 1   | ecookbook  | 2010-01-01         | 2010-02-28       |
        | Rel 2   | ecookbook  | 2010-03-01         | 2010-06-01       |
      And I have defined the following stories in the product backlog:
        | subject | release | points |
        | Story 1 | Rel 1   | 2 |
        | Story 2 | Rel 1   | 7 |
        | Story 3 | Rel 2   | 13 |
        | Story 4 | Rel 2   | 20 |
        | Story 5 |         | 40 |
      And I have defined the following stories in the following sprints:
        | subject | sprint     | release | points |
        | Story A | Sprint 001 | Rel 1   | 2 |
        | Story B | Sprint 002 | Rel 1   | 3 |
        | Story C | Sprint 003 | Rel 2   | 5 |
        | Story D | Sprint 003 |         | 5 |

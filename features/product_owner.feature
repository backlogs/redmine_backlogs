Feature: Product Owner
  As a product owner
  I want to manage story details and story priority
  So that they get done according to my requirements

  Background:
    Given the ecookbook project has the backlogs plugin enabled
      And I am a product owner of the project
      And I have defined the following sprints:
        | name       | sprint_start_date | effective_date |
        | Sprint 001 | 2010-01-01        | 2010-01-31     |
        | Sprint 002 | 2010-02-01        | 2010-02-28     |
        | Sprint 003 | 2010-03-01        | 2010-03-31     |
        | Sprint 004 | 2010-03-01        | 2010-03-31     |
      And I have deleted all existing issues
      And I have defined the following stories in the product backlog:
        | position | subject |

        | 2        | Story 2 |
        | 3        | Story 3 |
        | 4        | Story 4 |
      And I have defined the following stories in the following sprints:
        | position | subject | sprint     |
        | 5        | Story A | Sprint 001 |
        | 6        | Story B | Sprint 001 |

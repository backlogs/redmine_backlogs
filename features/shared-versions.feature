Feature: Shared versions
  As a project manager 
  I want to use shared versions
  So that I can manage release over projects

  Background:
    Given the ecookbook project has the backlogs plugin enabled
      And the private-child project has the backlogs plugin enabled
      And the project6 project has the backlogs plugin enabled
      And the onlinestore project has the backlogs plugin enabled
      And sharing is enabled
      And no versions or issues exist
      And I am a team member of the project

      And I have defined the following sprints:
        | name       | sprint_start_date | effective_date | sharing   | project_id    |
        | Sprint 001 | 2010-01-01        | 2010-01-31     | hierarchy | ecookbook     |
        | Sprint 002 | 2010-02-01        | 2010-02-28     | none      | private-child |
        | Sprint 003 | 2010-03-01        | 2010-03-31     | tree      | project6      |
        | Sprint 004 | 2010-03-01        | 2010-03-31     | system    | onlinestore   |

      And I have defined the following stories in the following sprints:
        | subject | sprint     | project_id    |
        | Story 1 | Sprint 001 | ecookbook     |
        | Story 2 | Sprint 001 | ecookbook     |
        | Story 3 | Sprint 001 | ecookbook     |
        | Story 4 | Sprint 002 | private-child |

      And I have defined the following tasks:
        | subject | story  |
        | Task 1  | Story 1 |

      And I have defined the following impediments:
        | subject      | sprint     | blocks  |
        | Impediment 1 | Sprint 001 | Story 1 |
        | Impediment 2 | Sprint 001 | Story 2 |

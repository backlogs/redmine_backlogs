    YOU ARE ABOUT TO RESET THIS SPRINT!

    * Creation date will be set to the sprint start date
    * ALL modifications to the stories and tasks except notes
       will be DELETED
    * The current value will become the initial value for all
       story/task properties
    * State will be set to the default issue state

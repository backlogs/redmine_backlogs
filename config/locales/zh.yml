      YOU ARE ABOUT TO RESET THIS SPRINT!

      Are you sure you want to do this? Resetting the sprint
      will have the following effects on stories and tasks:

      * Creation date will be set to the sprint start date
      * ALL modifications to the stories and tasks except notes
         will be DELETED
      * The current value will become the initial value for all
         story/task properties
      * State will be set to the default issue state

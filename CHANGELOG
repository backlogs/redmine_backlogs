Statistics page fixed after burndown reimplementation

== 2011-07-16 v0.6.1

Reworked the burndown generation. It had become a tangled, hard-to-fix mess.
No longer requires the rake task to keep the burndown up-to-date.

Tasks and stories can now be properly rejected (see website for docs)

This version adds a migration -- make sure you run it!
